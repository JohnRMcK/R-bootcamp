head(flights)

#filter and slice
filter(flights, month == 11, day == 3, carrier == 'AA' )
#the notation is much neater that the subset code.
slice(flights, 1:10)#allows up so select rows by position

#arrange will reorder rows
head(arrange(flights, year, month, day, desc(arr_time)))

#select allows you to quickly select column subsets.
select(flights, carrier)

#rename allows the quick rename of columns. 
rename(flights, airline_carrier = carrier) #syntax is new name = oldname

#distict allows us to select the unique values ina column
distinct(flights, carrier)
#mutate
head(mutate(flights, new_col = arr_delay - dep_delay))
transmute(flights, morning_flight = dep_time > 1200 )
#transmute can be used instead of mutate but only returns the new col. 
#note the greater than used in the transmute example.

#summarise allows us to quicky collapse dataframes into single rows. it is similar the aggregate function in base r or the group by function in SQL.
summarise(flights, avg_air_time = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE))

#sample_n and sample_frac allow you to take a random slection of rows from you dataframe.
sample(flights, 10)
sample_frac(flights, .01)

#dplyer also allows for the %>% pipe operator which allows for multipule of the above to be applied in neat order.
