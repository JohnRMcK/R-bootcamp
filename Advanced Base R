#Advanced R
#Built in R Features and Functions

#seq() creates sequences
seq(0,50, by=2)

#sort() can be applies to sort a vector.
v <- c(1,6,7,99,2,44,3)
sort(v, decreasing = F)
sort(v, decreasing = T)

abc <- c('a','Z','H','i','A','L','B')
sort(abc)#will return a list with the lower case then the  uppercase letters. 

#rev() can be used to reverse the elements in an object.
rev(v)#does not orde the data in anyway, just makes a reverse.
# 1,2,3 would become 3,2,1

#append() can be used to merge together vectors and lists. 
a <- c(2,4,6)
b <- c(1,3,5)
append(a,b)
#result: [1] 2 4 6 1 3 5

#apply function
print(sample(x = 1:10,1))
#sample will be used for the apply examples.
#apply is useful when applyin a function to a vector. 
addran <- function(x){
  ran <- sample(1:100, 1)
  return (x+ran)
}
print(addran(10))
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
lapply(v, addran)#listapply but is usefuk with vectors. 
sapply(v, addran)#produces a cleaner vector of output. 
#help(lapply) will give a list of all the available "apply" functions.

#Regular expressions: searching for petterns in a string or a vector of strings
text <- "Do you know who you are voting for?"
grepl('voting', text)
#grepl returns a logical.
text2 <- c("Hello", "Goodbye", "Farewell friend", "So long")
grep('Farewell', text2)
#grep returns the index in the vector of strings
#note if the search term is in the string it will return.

#Dates and Times
input_date <- as.Date("Dec-31-18", format = "%B-%d-%y")
#%d for day number with zero efore days 1-9.
#%m for month number
#%y for 2 digit year
#%b for abbreviate month name
#%b for full month name
#%Y for 4 digit year
as.POSIXct("11:45:15", format = "%H:%M:%S")#input the time 11:45 and 15 seconds AM.
#converts strings into timestamp information which will be useful for time series.
#result from above is [1] "2020-05-22 11:45:15 EDT"
#note that day, month, year and time zone were filled in from system time. 

#More common function than as.POSIXct
help(strptime)
strptime("11:45:15", format = "%H:%M:%S")
#there is also the library(lubridate) that has been developed to make working with dates earlier.
